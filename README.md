## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flex
- Used my small self-built CSS library
- JS 

### What I learned

First project with JS implemented, learnt how to deal with different error cases such as 0/0. Also dealed with many math functions in a real project for the first time.

### Continued development

I'd like to implement more flex/grid usage, semantic HTML5, make the JS more organized and with better time and storage complexity.
